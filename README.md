# Spring Boot Secrets Manager Test

REST API designed to demonstrate a straightforward integration between Java, Spring Boot, and AWS Secrets Manager, leveraging the AWS SDK and an in-memory cache for efficient secret retrieval. This project provides a minimal and practical reference for learning, testing, and validating how secret storage, access patterns, and caching strategies behave in a controlled AWS environment. The focus is on maintainable code, clear architecture, and a simple workflow suitable for experimentation, technical onboarding, or internal tooling.
